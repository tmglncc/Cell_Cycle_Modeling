# python-loader
Python data loader for PhysiCell digital snapshots.
Rf. http://www.mathcancer.org/blog/python-loader/

Additional scripts for plotting PhysiCell output can be found in the `plotting` directory. You can copy these into your PhysiCell `output` directory and run them there. They require the `scipy` and `matplotlib` Python modules, so we recommend installing the Anaconda Python 3.x distribution (https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/).
